# Expectations for reaction times

## Email

You can check the email once a day during weekdays.

## Slack

1-2h during office hours

## Phone

If it's more urgent than slack I will call you. 

Instead of reacting to events on slack, plan time for checking and replying. In this way you take control of the situation instead of asynchronously reacting to events. 

# Asking for help

It takes some time for people to get an understanding for when to ask for help. The way I see it is a sliding scale where people naturally gravitate towards either asking too fast or asking too late for help. 

- You need to identify where you are on that scale

When onboarding it's expected that you ask a lot of questions. For the first 3-6 months you should ask questions to understand and be curios about the domain. 

## Asking too fast

- Make sure that you have checked the basic facts before asking someone for help.
- Take a break and try first on your own
- Book regular checkups instead of async grabbing someone

## Asking too late

- Understand that it's part of senior devs, engineering managers and CTOs job description to help other people

Expectation: you should never by stuck longer than max 4 hours on some task. Preferable not longer than 2 hours. 

- Team output will always outperform individual performance. Don't let your stubbornness get in the way of the team output.
- People will not think you are annoying for asking for help as long as you come prepared.

# Concentration in the workplace

Headphones means *don't disturb.* If you need to talk to someone with headphones: use slack. 

If you have issues concentrating, see if you can organize the workspace to avoid distractions. 

- Don't have any tabs open with distraction, such as facebook
- Pause notifications on your phone or put it away.

# Multi tasking

The simple answer is: *don't do it.* Multi tasking and context switching is the death of productivity. 

If you are responsible for organization and have a high contact surface you need a bucket where you put tasks that arrive async. For me personally I've been using a personal Kanban board where I put stuff in like tickets. Tickets can get created at any time but that does not mean that I will do them directly. I take control of the situation by planning in my calendar when to do stuff from that board. 

- Separate work instantiation from work implementation
- It takes somewhere between 30-45 minutes to refocus. So make sure to minimize it for you and others.
- Humans cannot multitask. Instead we context switch. The context switch is really mentally taxing and we simply are not effective at it.

# Working with the calendar

It’s good to have a todo list or Kanban board to collect things as you go along in your work week. However, that is not enough. You also need to allocate time to do them, otherwise you will simply never success since you will end up with a list that is only growing. In order to do more effective time management I sugest you consider the following actions: 

- Challenge the 1h meeting. Instead of accepting a 1h meeting, instead try and figure out how much time would be reasonable to solve it in. If you cannot make an estimate, at least default to 30 minutes.
- Work with optional attendance in the meeting invitations to show who needs to be there and who can be there.
- If you don’t think that you need to be on the meeting, ask the organizer if it’s ok that you join in the last 5 minutes for a summary.
- Always as for an agenda and see if you can do it solve it with documentation you already have in place or just by having a collaboration through a document that you work async on.
- Try and book meetings so that they don’t interrupt your or the attendants workflow. Good times to book meetings can be:
    - Right before or after lunch
    - First thing in the morning or after standup
    - last thing before you leave for the day

In addition to this it can be effective to also bok meetings with yourself. Each day, take a look at your todo and plan in the activities in your calendar throughout the week. Also, not all problems are urgent and many things can be done next week.
