# Development office organization

Tags: policy

This document describes what I think is important when organizing the physical space for the development department. 

## Teams should sit together

It helps with communication so that you don't have to go and grab someone at the office. You also get to know your team members a little better if you physically are close to each other. 

It will also enable a small but silly aspect of the team altar. Basically some team related artefacts, like papers, mascots or whatever that really helps build a sense of team belongingness. 

## Avoid greeting spaces

No person should be located in a place where people walk by a lot and they will have to greet every person. For example, having your desk right by the entrance to the office so that you will automatically have eye contact when people arrive. It would be weird not to say hello but also very distracting. 

It takes about 30-40 minutes to refocus as a developer after your flow have been disturbed. 

## Avoid noisy spaces

This one is pretty self explanatory. 

## Team altar

It can be a movable whiteboard, mob station or some mascot. Itâ€™s silly but builds a team belongingness.
