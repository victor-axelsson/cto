# How to build a procces

Tags: policy, process

Building new processes are hard. The purpose of having a process to begin with is probably because some work task requires coordination of people because the task at hand is nontrivial. 

This document suggest things to consider and ways to implement them. The document is opinionated and open for comments. 

## Expectation management

Most people don't like change. The reasons to why can be become quite philosophical but the statement itself is actually not quite correct either; it's oversimplified. A less incorrect statement would be: 

- People like novelty
- People like familiarity

If you create a new process that will paradigmatically change the way we work it will not be familiar but it will be novel. It will stress the employee a lot and create a lot of discontent. 

If you create a process that is not novel, let's say time logging, many devs at our company have logged their hours as consultants at previous employments, so it will be familiar but not novel. It will create stress and discontent. When introducing a new process the part that you will struggle with is not to find novel approaches but instead of introducing familiarity at an acceptable pace. 

One way of introducing familiarity is by soft launching a process and through repetition with small progressive steps making it more and more familiar. 

- Introduce people to the process change by mentioning it 3 times with gradually more information
- Setup training sessions, brainstorm sessions and tutorial material

Manage the expectation so that people understand that the process will not be good in the first iteration. It takes some modification, even after rollout, to get it good. The last thing you want is that the process sneaks up on them and BOOM, they are expected to work in unfamiliar ways. 

Even if you do the expectation management perfect there will always be couple of people that, regardless of how well you prepared, have totally missed it. So prepare how to deal with catching that as well. 

## Ownership

It's really important that each process introduction is owned by a specific person responsible for outlining the progress, specifying the artifacts needed to do the expectation management and documenting the process for external reviews. This person should be accountable for making the necessary changes and should have the autonomy to do so. 

This person will most likely take a little heat from different stakeholder that are discontent from loosing familiarity. So make sure that this person is someone capable of dealing with that heat. Otherwise, they will be be burned out or feel really bad because they think they are loosing collegial respect. 

## Iterate and evaluate

For expectation management, try and make the first version of the process simple and clear. Think about it like an MVP. You remove all the bells ans whistles and store them away for the upcoming versions; you are aware of them and can pull them out if necessary in upcoming versions. You wanna get fast feedback on the process, so make it simple, and then iterate.

- MVP of the process
- Should be simple to understand

It's important here to understand that just because you roll out something small it does not mean that it's not *very well worked through*. The buffer for errors is small, so make sure that you are confident in the parts that you actually will start enforcing.

It's important that you already in the MVP think about how the key results look like. They don't necessarily have to be metric KPIs. But you should at least be able to check a couple of boxes to see if you have achieved something that was intended.

- Specify key results

Once you have rolled out the MPV, iterate and follow up on key results. 

- Follow up on KR and identify new ones for the second version

What is important is that during all this process change is that the processes should never be so disruptive so that there is a risk of putting the companies operation at risk. As a department and company our primary goal is to *always stay operational*. Even if that sometimes means by-stepping processes. It might not be a bad idea to early-on think about how you can bypass the process in case of emergency and who should be allowed to do that. 

## Transparency

While I generally like working with quite high transparency there are a couple of times where I prefer not to. One of these places is when working on a new process. 

When working on a new process, communicating it is part of the rollout. If you are communicating an unpolished process it will stress the hell out of people because they think it's going in the wrong direction. But during brainstorming you take a lot of bad turns and that is fine. Nothing is final until we decide to roll it out and by that time you will have had the time to become familiar with the novel process. So to summarize: 

- Transparency can create a lot of unnecessary stress

At the same time, we generally don't have to lock down the documents and brainstorming artifacts.

- Access to artifacts can be available but not marketed
- Explain that stakeholders will have their say before rollout

If you work with low transparency you can get a lot of head-start in these process elicitations by carefully listening to people and documenting the problems before brainstorming. It can help you to scope the problem. 

- You can get a head start by collecting info at any stage

## Apply lean methodologies

While I try not to micro manage too much I really think that you should consider the elements from lean methodologies. Most of them have really good empirical output. Just to mention a few: 

- Think pull Instead of push
- MVP - Minimum viable product
- One piece flow
- 5 whys

You will of course see when and how these apply to your specific process. 

## Timing

Timing a process rollout is always super important. Specifically when *not* to roll it out or *when* to communicate big changes. Here are some basic guidelines: 

- Not close to big releases or new markets
- Not when running other big process changes
- Not when morale is low
- Give at least 1 week breathing room before starting up new big process
- Celebrate rollout when you are past the worst chaos, not in the middle of it.

You have to consider the morale bank account of the employees. If the buffer is high you can go for it but make sure you are not running bankrupt on the morale bank account. You can of course always try and minimize the bad morale but you always need to make sure that you liquidity in case you fail.
