# Expectations

It can be quite overwhelming to start in a new workplace with a lot of new people that you will have to get to know. On top of this you might have expectations on yourself and feel an urge to start showing your skills in your profession. For that reason it can be good to know what kind of expectations the company will have on you during your onboarding period.

- It should take about a day or two to set up the computer and equipment and begin to understand our products.

Unless you are using some custom tools you should be ready to start looking into the code after the first day or so. Try and use the same tools as everybody else and they can help you get up and running.

- You should make a commit your first week e.g. pull request to the development branch.

This is so that you get up and running with your computer and tools and don’t build some barrier towards the work you are expected to perform.

In order to get an understanding of how we work and the system is put together you should probably ask a lot of questions. In general people tend to either ask too many questions or too few and be somewhere on that scale. You will need to figure out where on that scale you are and adjust accordingly. In the beginning it’s expected that you will have a lot of questions and people around you will have an understanding of that. Don’t be afraid of asking. People here are nice and want you to succeed in your work.

- You will ask a lot of questions.

The team also needs to get to know you. Give them some feedback if there is something that is not working out.

- You will raise your voice if something is not working out.
